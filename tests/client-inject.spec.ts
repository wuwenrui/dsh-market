/**
 * What the market's client declares it needs, against what it touches.
 *
 * `dsh.client.inject` is a HARD gate: the host holds the client entry back
 * until every listed seam exists. A seam that is listed but never used is
 * therefore not free — it is a version of the host the market refuses to
 * run on, bought for nothing.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. @MarchLiu found (#554) that on dsh 0.1.2-rc.1
 * the market's presence silently stopped `dsh-context` from registering its
 * commands, and traced it by binary search to the market's entry alone. The
 * market listed `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-runtime` — a seam that release
 * ships incompletely, and that had already hard-failed another plugin's
 * boot — and `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-connection`, and used NEITHER. Both
 * had been in the manifest since 0.1.0 and never removed when the code that
 * might have needed them was not written.
 *
 * This test is the thing that was missing: a declaration and its use, kept
 * next to each other. It reads the client source rather than a hand-written
 * list, so adding `ctx.something` without declaring its seam fails too.
